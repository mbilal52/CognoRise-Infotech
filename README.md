COGNORISE InfoTech DATA SCIENCE INTERNSHIP

TASK 1: IRIS FLOWER DATASETS
DESCRIPTION:
TASK 1
IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION
• The Iris flower dataset encompasses three distinct species: setosa, versicolor, and 
virginica. 
• These species are discernible through specific measurements. Imagine possessing 
measurements of Iris flowers categorized by their distinct species. 
• The goal is to train a machine learning model capable of learning from these 
measurements and proficiently categorizing Iris flowers into their corresponding 
species.
• Employ the Iris dataset to construct a model adept at classifying Iris flowers into 
distinct species based on their sepal and petal measurements. 
• This dataset serves as a prevalent choice for initial classification tasks, making it 
ideal for introductory learning experiences

TASK 3
TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION
• Utilize the Titanic dataset to construct a predictive model determining if a 
passenger survived the Titanic disaster. 
• This project serves as an introductory exercise, offering accessible data for analysis.
• The dataset comprises passenger details encompassing age, gender, ticket class, 
fare, cabin, and survival outcome.
• By applying this data, you can embark on a classic project that provides insights 
into survival patterns among Titanic passengers.
