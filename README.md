TASK 1: IRIS FLOWER DATASETS
DESCRIPTION:
TASK 1
IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION
• The Iris flower dataset encompasses three distinct species: setosa, versicolor, and 
virginica. 
• These species are discernible through specific measurements. Imagine possessing 
measurements of Iris flowers categorized by their distinct species. 
• The goal is to train a machine learning model capable of learning from these 
measurements and proficiently categorizing Iris flowers into their corresponding 
species.
• Employ the Iris dataset to construct a model adept at classifying Iris flowers into 
distinct species based on their sepal and petal measurements. 
• This dataset serves as a prevalent choice for initial classification tasks, making it 
ideal for introductory learning experiences
